# SSW-215-MLProject
  This repo contains a class project utilizing machine learning concepts to accurately predict if an image is of a cat or a dog.
  Our model utilizes the pre-trained tensorflow MobileNet V2 model as well as our own pooling layer and dense prediction layer.
  The accuracy of this model is 98.5%
  

## HOW TO USE MODEL
  - Add images of cats and dogs to the TestImages directory.
  - Run the testing.py program.
  - All images in the TestImages directory will have predictions made.
